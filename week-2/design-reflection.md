**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**

The six phases of web design are:
- Information gathering
- Planning
- Design
- Development
- Testing and delivery
- Maintenance

**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

The primary purpose of my site is to curate all of the content I produce.

My site will feature an about me page which will give visitors a brief overview of who I am.

There will also be page which displays images of different projects I’ve worked on, along with a blog that discusses technical topics.

Finally, there will be a contact page where someone can view my social media profiles relating to code or email me.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

The three primary interests of my audience are:

1. Get in contact with me
2. View projects I’ve worked on
3. Read my blog

The way I designed my site is that there is a header present on every single page. So no matter where a person goes in my site there is always a easy way to get to another page.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

The primary action people should take when visiting my site is viewing my portfolio and/or reading my blogs.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

One of the critical things I learned is that design/user experience is a lot more then how something looks. Instead, a major portion of design is about helping to establish the purpose of a site, defining the target audience, and understanding a person’s motivations for coming to that site.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

User experience is how a person feels when interacting with a system. User experience design is the discipline of understanding users motivations for visiting a site. With this information they can establish a design hierarchy that helps the user accomplish those goals.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**
I struggled with reading through the 'What is User Experience Design?' article. While it contained a lot of helpful information about user experience. It was just rather long, and it took me awhile to finish.
