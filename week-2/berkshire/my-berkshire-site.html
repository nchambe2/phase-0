        <h3>What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?</h3>
        <p>For me I don't retain much information when I just read about things. 
            So it was great practice to actually apply what I've been reading about. 
            By doing this there were definatly some topics I thought I understood, but when it was time to use them I realized that I didn't.
        </p>
        <h3>How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?</h3>
        <p>Researching and using semantic HTML5 elements opened up a whole new world for me.
            I really liked the additions of new tags like header, footer, aside, etc. 
            Having these tags helped me to avoid the trap of using tons of divs which isn't as expressive.
        </p>
        <h3>How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)?</h3>
        <p> There were definatly some slips when it came to keeping to best practices. 
            I've taken classes on HTML/CSS before, and even created webpages.
            Looking back I realize that I never never heard anyone encourage or How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)  enforce the notion that HTML is strictly for presentation. 
            So I have a lot of bad practices engrained in me. Before starting my pair and I talked out each section.
            I thought this was helpful because we were able to catch ourselves talking about implementing styling i.e. adding bold tags to text before we actually started coding.
        </p>
        <h3>What seems good and bad about HTML?</h3>
        <p>I don't know if there is anything inherently good/bad about HTML. 
            However, I do know there are a lot of people (including myself) who use a lot of bad practices when it comes to HTML.
            The way in which HTML is taught could be strengthened. Right now a lot of tutorials and classes don't do a great job in emphasising the presentation and semantic purpose of HTML.
        </p>
        <h3>What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?</h3>
        <p>Prior to DBC I honestly didn't have any tricks to remembering HTML.
          If I couldn't remember something I just googled it. 
          I really appericated the link that was included in the HTML: A Primer video.
          I was really struggling to understand when to use certain HTML5 tags, and having that flowchart handy is a great trick I will use in the future.
