                Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
             </h1>
          </header>

            <p>You can liken creating a repository on GitHub to creating a project folder on Google
               drive. First, you navigate to GitHub, fill out a form with some information about your project folder such as it the project name, project description, whether the project folder contents should be public or private, a README which provides information about the project, and a open source license if you plan to give rights to others to share and view your project.
            </p>
            <p>Like Google Drive you now have a project folder that you can interact with via Google
               Drive's websites. However, the project is not saved locally onto your machine. In order to save the project folder locally you would have to download it.</p>
            <p>A similar thing has to happen if you want to interact locally with your project folder
               from GitHub. However, instead of downloading the folder you clone it onto your machine. Once you finish cloning the project folder you can now view the contents, add new contents, and edit exisiting contents.</p>

<!--
  What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  I've continued to return to the header tag. Since most pages have headers is a pretty useful tag to.

  How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

  The browser reads the HTML file from top to bottom converting the elements into DOM nodes.
  Then elements are then laid out based on their default position.
  Then styling will be applied if there is an internal or external stylesheets.

  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?
  I learned that you can create code snippets. 
  These code snippets are handy if you type a lot of the same things again and again.
  The was probably the tip of the iceberg in terms of the other tips and tricks Sublime has to make you more efficient.

  Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  I definately will. I'm not sure which snippets yet, but I'm sure I will find some more to create down the road.

  What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  I think learning more shortcuts would be handy. 
  Right now I don't really know many. 
  I think learning keyboard shortcuts helps you become a more efficient programmer.
