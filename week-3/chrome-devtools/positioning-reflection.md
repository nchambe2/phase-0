**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**
Using Chrome DevTools allows you to make experimentally styling to elements, and see the results of that styling immediately reflected in the browser window.

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**
If you want to resize elements you can use the width and height style property to make the element bigger or smaller.

**What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**

* Static: The normal behavior of all elements are static.

* Relative: Moves the element relative to where it originally was positioned.

* Fixed: The element is placed relative to the browser. So the element stays in place when scrolling occurs.

* Absolute:  Places a page element relative to the nearest parent element that has relative or absolute positioning.

When I first researched the different positioning properities I thought absolute would be the easiest to use, and relative positioning would be the hardest.

However, after having to use the different positioning properities when working through the challenges I found relative positioning to be the easier to work with than absolute.

**What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**
All elements are surrounded by a invisible box. That invisible box is made up of the content, the padding which directly surronds the content, the border which surrounds the padding, and finally the margin. Margins are used for placing spacing between elements. Padding is used to increase the space around the content area without affecting the size of the content. While borders add a frame around the padding and content.

**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**

I hated this challenge, but it was good hate. Positioning was really difficult for me to grasp. I had to do a lot of outside reading to wrap my head around how to use each property correctly. While I'm not there yet this challenge really forced me to acknowledge my weakness in this area, and try to get better.

Using Chrome DevTools was awesome. I was able to apply styling and see the affects in the browser immediately. Which is much faster than editing the css file, and refreshing the browser window.
