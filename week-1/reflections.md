**Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?**

I was most attracted to reading about how mindfulness, meditation, time-boxing, and getting into the zone helps increase productivity. I honestly came into this particular activity very resistant to reading any of the material. In the past I’ve read time management and productivity books/articles that have done nothing but make me feel bad. However, I realize now that the material I was reading was essentially trying to turn me into a “productivity robot”.  So no wonder I didn’t want to read them.

I really enjoyed the article about the “Seven Counterintuitive Ways To Be Insanely Productive”. I realized that my body was often times telling me about what things really excited me, and what things didn’t. A lot of time my procrastination was born out of me continually doing tasks that didn’t make me feel alive.

Nevertheless, the reality is that there are always going to be certain tasks I don’t want to do that I must do regardless about how I feel about them. During those times I shouldn’t struggle in silence. Instead, I should talk about it with other people and have them support me in getting things done.

**What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?**

Time boxing is when you define a goal, and the maximum amount of time you will work on that goal . (This time can vary from minutes to weeks. ) After the maximum amount of time has been reached you stop working, and evaluate how much progress has been made towards meeting your goal.

I think time boxing is a great idea for approaching tasks in Phase 0 that are extremely hard. When I see a task that is really hard I will often procrastinate because I fear the task will be too overwhelming. However, if I pre-define a maximum amount time I am willing to work on a certain task it will help to alleviate some of that fear.

Once that time is up I can take a step back and re-evaluate if the way I am approaching the problem is a good way to look at it, or should I look at it from a different angle. I can also decide whether or not I need to take a break, and then come back to working on the task.

**How do you manage your time currently?**

Currently, I keep a calendar that includes meetings I have for work or other events I plan to attend. Outside of using a calendar I just honestly go with the flow, and hope I complete what I need to get done for that day.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

Not really. While having a calendar is helpful it doesn’t address the two main problems I have: procrastinating on finishing tasks that either seem too hard or too easy.

**Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?**

I will employ keeping a calendar so that way I will know what day certain meetings, activities, and assignments are due. I think that it’s helpful to have a centralized place where you can view when everything you have to do is happening.

**What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?**

After reading the articles in this section my overall plan for time management has changed.

For one, I will practice time boxing and attempting to get into the flow as often as possible. Instead of hammering away at a really difficult problems, I think a better approach is to break down complex tasks into more digestible chunks of work. Then assess whether or not the way I am working is the most efficient approach for myself.

I’m also interested in practicing mindfulness. I tend to get really distracted when working on things. I realize that my lack of focus is often due to the fact that I am not really mentally present. My mind is always thinking of a million different things. I think that practicing focusing in on the moment, and soaking up what’s going on without judgement will actually help calm my mind and keep me focused.

**What is a shell? What is "bash?"**

The shell is a software program that allows a person to interact with their operating system without using the GUI. Bash is a type of shell that is used on UNIX environments.

What was the most challenging thing for you in going through this material?

The most challenging thing for me going through this material was trying to learn about editing my bash profile and changing permissions on files and folders. I didn't have any previous experience with these concepts, so I had to re-watch those parts of the video a couple of times.

**Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**

Yes, I was able to use all the command. Some commands like pushd, popd, and understanding how pipes and redirection worked took me the most time to get comfortable with.

**In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**

I think the most important commands and arguments to know are cd, ls, -l, pwd, and grep.

As a programmer you will probably often have to change into different directories to edit and add content, view the contents that live under different files, see where you are currently at, and search for certain words quite often.

**Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.**

- pwd: Prints out the full path to directory you are currently in

- ls: Lists the contents of the directory you are currently in

- mv: Moves a file or folder from one place to another

- cd: Used to change into a different directory

- ../: Goes one directory up from the one you are currently in

- touch: Creates a empty file

- mkdir: Creates a directory/folder

- less: Prints out the contents of the file. Allows you to page up and down through the file's contents

- rmdir: Removes a directory/folder

- rm: Removes a file

- help: A windows command that gives you detailed information about what the command does and how to use it.

**If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be?**

*Creating a New Repo:*

1. In order to create a new repo on Github your first step is to click on the + sign located on the right hand side in the header
2. Clicking on a plus sign should reveal a drop down
3. Click on the option that says “New Repository”
4. You will then be taken to a page called “Create a new repository”
5. Go ahead and name your repo.
6. If you want you can provide a short description that describes the repo. Filling this field out is optional.
7. Next you must decide whether you want to make your repo public or  private. If you choose to make it public anyone can view the contents of the repo. However, you still have power over who can make changes to the repo. While a private repo will only be viewable to those who have been designated as contributors.
8. Next you can choose to create your repo with a README file. The README file provides information around what the project is, how to set up the project, and more. If you choose not to create your repo with a README file, you can always create one later.
9. You can choose to add a .gitignore file. If there are files you don’t want git to track, you can add them to the .gitignore file. If you are not sure right now what files you want git to ignore you can always create a .gitignore file later.
10. You can also choose to add a license. Since GitHub encourages open source software it’s a good idea especially if your repo is public to add a license which will outline the terms under which another person can share and contribute to your code.
11. The final step is to click on the create repository button
12. Then you should be redirected to your newly create repo!

*Cloning  the Repo:*

1. In order to make changes to the repo you just set up you will need to copy the code onto your local machine.
On the left hand side of your repo homepage you will see a box that says HTTPS clone url. You can also choose to clone your repo via  ssh or subversion if you have those set up.  Once you have selected the one you want copy the URL link.
2. Navigate back to your terminal and cd into the directory where you want your project to live.
Once you are there type the following command into your terminal window: git clone <repo_url>
Once you have done that type ls to confirm that that the project has been successfully cloned onto your local machine.

*Forking a Repo:*

1. Navigate to the repo that you want to fork
2. On the far right hand side of the page click on a button that says Fork
3. A prompt should appear asking you “Where the repo should be forked?” Click on your personal account.
4. After you click on your personal account you will be redirected to the forked repo. To confirm this look at the [username]/[repo_name] to confirm that you see your username and the forked repo name.
Cloning a Forked Repo:

The steps for cloning a forked repo are essentially the same. One thing you want to make sure of is that you clone the forked URL, and not the URL from the original repo.



**Why would you fork a repository as opposed to creating a new one?**

If you come across a public repo that you find interesting and you decide you want to work on it you can fork the repo. Unless, you’ve created a repo or have been added as a contributor to a repo you will not have access to push to that repo’s repository. Forking a repo provides a work around to that issue. When you fork a repo it creates a copy of the code that now lives on your GitHub account. Now you can create a local repo on your computer, and make changes to the forked codebase without affecting the original one. You can choose to use the forked codebase as starting point for your own project, or you can create a pull request and have your changes merged into the original repo.

**What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?**

My struggles were less around setting up git & GitHub and more around understanding the concept of forking. I was confused about why someone would want to fork a repo. So I stopped and did some research, on how forking fits into the git workflow.

This is a great [article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) that highlighted the primary reasons a person would fork a repo:

1. propose an enhancement or bug fix to someone else's project

2. use another person’s project as a starting point for your own project

Taking the time to stop and dig a little bit deeper into the why of a topic helps me to figure out more easily how this concept could be used by me.
